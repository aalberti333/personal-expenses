# Personal Expenses App

A mobile application to manage personal expenses. A project from Maximilian Schwarzmüller's Flutter Udemy course.

## Setup

Dart and Flutter will both need to be installed. Look to their docs for how to install/configure.

For running and editing, I personally recommend the following setup:
* Genymotion for virtual android device
* VSCode with Flutter/Dart extensions enabled
* Android Studio (Download this only for the SDK, just use VSCode for your editor)

VSCode and Genymotion ran exceptionally well with little configuration, whereas Android Studio's editor/virtual device manager completely ate up my machine's resources. There's probably a way to configure Android Studio to run more effectively, but the alternative was simpler for me to pick up and run with.

After cloning the project, navigate into the root directory and run `flutter pub get` and then `flutter run`.
